Demo of a simple calorie calculator built with Cycle JS

Build to compare functional web app creation with unidirectional data flow using Cycle JS and Elm.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This project uses Cycle JS, WebPack, and Babel. To build it you will need a recent version of [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) running on your machine.

### Installing

Install npm dependencies

```
npm install
```

Use WebPack to build the calculator

```
npm run build
```

Open a browser and run the calculator

```
open index.html
```

## Deployment

WebPack makes a single JS bundle to bind the calculator. See the `index.html` file for an example of how to create a mounting point in the HTML and load the JS.
